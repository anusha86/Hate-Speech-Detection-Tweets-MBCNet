762,cCImt7hpwsk,cCImt7hpwsk_2,Donald Trump Changed My Mind.,originally my position was that you know we're better than that there's no need to be doing that you certainly can't hold people without probable cause etc but I've kind of shifted away from that so we are engaged in a war right there is there I have people who there are people who have declared war on the United States and the United States is responding to that now we you know we sign the Geneva Convention and with certain parties we've entered to an agreement that we should we're going to behave like civilized people this is going,-1

764,cCImt7hpwsk,cCImt7hpwsk_4,Donald Trump Changed My Mind.,however when somebody else then rejects that and sends you videos of people of violating those exact terms and says known where they will be chopping off heads we're going to be doing some other horrific despicable things that we haven't seen since medieval times then I think is completely acceptable to take the gloves off and just treat them as they treat you so you offer it to them you know you'll be the big person let them define the rules of warfare they have defined the rules of work warfare as we're gonna go medieval no problem we,1

772,cGzWIni_o04,cGzWIni_o04_2,Police Fire Paint Rounds at Citizens Sitting on Their Porch,i guess between the citizens and their law enforcement this article starts a video appears to show law enforcement shooting paint rounds at citizens on their porch i don't think it appears to do anything it definitely shows all right we'll go through the video quick here [Music] are you okay you can see they were clearly shot at um this video is luckily going viral i thought at first when i saw that they were going to try and suppress it but i've seen it on a couple network sites this one's coming out of cbs minnesota the irony,-1
773,cGzWIni_o04,cGzWIni_o04_3,Police Fire Paint Rounds at Citizens Sitting on Their Porch,i think is the wcco when i saw that i thought it said waco wow question i guess becomes what do you think do you think the police are in the right to do what they did these citizens were told directly by law enforcement to get inside and they didn't but are they not allowed to sit on their porch and videotape and anyone who knows the story of waco the argument was always who fired first law enforcement showed up that day and i think seven fbi agents or something were either shot or killed in the first,1

845,hbU9x6K-5RI,hbU9x6K-5RI_1,"Chasing After the Wind - June 19, 2022",might say be careful who you listen to because not everyone who sounds wise actually is and so he kicks it off with this kind of interesting verse uh wisdom statement in verse one he says as dead flies give perfume a bad smell so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor you that's kind of gross right now it's not exactly clear how the flies got into the oil or how the flies give the oil a bad smell and so you know one of the commentaries i read said that it's probably difficult for us to translate into,1
846,hbU9x6K-5RI,hbU9x6K-5RI_2,"Chasing After the Wind - June 19, 2022",english what the teacher is actually saying here and unlike many other passages it helps us to kind of look at the original hebrew and take a more literal interpretation even though it doesn't read as poetically it helps us to get more at the deeper meaning at first glance we might assume that this is a statement that reads kind of like first corinthians 15 33 where paul said do not be misled bad company corrupts good character however even though this is true the teacher's proverbs here is a little bit more nuanced than that the translation is,-1
847,hbU9x6K-5RI,hbU9x6K-5RI_3,"Chasing After the Wind - June 19, 2022",a little stilted but more literally what the teacher has said is as the flies of death emit a stinking odor they pour forth scented oil so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor i don't know if that's easier to understand or not but in the same way that people used scented oil and spices to prepare dead bodies for burial right we recognize that in the story of jesus after he was crucified and they took his body and they prepared it for burial by anointing it with oil and spices the spices were to cover the stink,1
848,hbU9x6K-5RI,hbU9x6K-5RI_4,"Chasing After the Wind - June 19, 2022",of death to cover over the smell that a decaying body starts to emit as it starts to decay and and we know i mean i don't want to get too graphic but when a body starts decay you start to see maggots and maggots turn into flies and so flies are a symbol of death and so the flies of death suggest that he's talking about a dead body and he's suggesting that fools pour forth scented oil or we could take oil to mean speech a kind of speech that is an attempt to cover over the stink,1
849,hbU9x6K-5RI,hbU9x6K-5RI_5,"Chasing After the Wind - June 19, 2022",of death to hide the foolishness of their deceit and so what they're really doing is they're attempting to fool the people by what they say with their words does that make more sense so too often the teacher is saying the words of fools are what prevail in public discourse it's too often what we pay attention to is human beings it's too often what people choose to prefer to listen to and to believe the only place where this verb form appears apparently is in proverbs 13 5 where the niv again says the righteous hate what is,1
850,hbU9x6K-5RI,hbU9x6K-5RI_6,"Chasing After the Wind - June 19, 2022",false but the wicked make themselves a stench and bring shame on themselves or again a more literal translation says a wicked person emits a stinking odor and is put to shame in many other places in the old testament we can see that that oil is often used as a symbol and a reference that refers to wicked and deceitful speech so he's talking about the words that we use and the speech that we listen to as human beings so in essence the word the words of fools the teacher is telling us are our foul smelling were,1

1069,8idz6DwHFd0,8idz6DwHFd0_2,Way to go Hogarth in demeaning that 47 members got unjustly expelled from MA,don't care about the drama du jour you know susan people getting expelled from their state party is a bit more than the drama du jour it must be easy for you who are not expelled and who you know self-righteously when you're one of the rudest people on the lnc to vote to fraudulently remove the dually elected secretary but what a position a privilege when you're not being expelled from your state party to just blithely hand wave what's going on with these members whose rights are getting violated as the drama du jour i hope one day,-1
1070,8idz6DwHFd0,8idz6DwHFd0_3,Way to go Hogarth in demeaning that 47 members got unjustly expelled from MA,when you're in crisis when somebody does something really wrong to you that you don't get to see someone in a position of power hand wave away your crisis i hope that doesn't happen to you how dare you but this is the attitude that so many members of the lnc have to the problems that are going on in affiliates it's just the drama du jour do you even know how you sound and look to the average member you haven't been on the lnc long enough to be that freaking clueless have you my god the real problems,1
1071,8idz6DwHFd0,8idz6DwHFd0_4,Way to go Hogarth in demeaning that 47 members got unjustly expelled from MA,in this party are not mere drama susan they are real real problems that affect real flesh and blood people with real feelings they're not the mere drama du jour you ought to be ashamed absolutely ashamed of yourself but on to the topic of your email thread yes every lmc member do thank you calls there's nothing better in this world than a thank you but also don't hand wave away the real problems in this party it's just mere drama you'll never solve it that way and you aren't showing oh dignity and respect oh no susan would,1

1095,EUYjGHpbZP8,EUYjGHpbZP8_2,Southwest Airlines &quot;Adventures&quot; Part 2,and my luggage is sitting in Portland hopefully I will be sitting in Portland at some point today after going to Albuquerque and Las Vegas first but my luggage is in Portland and my wallet I went to the lost and found it was not at the lost and found but while I was at the lost and found I discovered that I was a big dumbass that when you have a hot pink wallet and hot pink bag that sometimes the hot pink wallet gets camouflaged at the bottom of the hot pink bag like a army person in,1

1099,0IW7fNvZh-o,0IW7fNvZh-o_2,My Southwest Airlines &quot; Adventures&quot; Part 4,ass has to sit in the airport again for five hours like I did yesterday if they cancel this flight if it's delayed fine I won't be happy but fine because it's a direct flight and I'm not counting on any connecting flights but if it's canceled they need to give me flights for like free for a year or something like this is unboxing real and something I noticed it's ever since they added Colorado Springs as one of their spots in Colorado it's been problems and the flight that keeps getting delayed is going to Colorado Springs first,-1
1100,0IW7fNvZh-o,0IW7fNvZh-o_3,My Southwest Airlines &quot; Adventures&quot; Part 4,that just always seems to be the problem it's  Colorado Springs I don't know what's going on with you people in Springs but you need to cut it out but anyway allegedly I'm leaving at 8 15. Denver time on a direct flight to Portland to still get there at 10.

1133,A-5g0fQcLvQ,A-5g0fQcLvQ_2,"Shall, best practices, and conflicts",to do a thing or ways of doing thing but it doesn't necessarily provide everything in other words it's a floor not a ceiling so if i say to you you know you shall contact somebody this afternoon that doesn't tell you how to do it so you could contact them in person you could contact them by phone you could contact them by email carrier pigeon telegram maybe some semaphore right there's a whole bunch of potential options here so best practices doesn't necessarily encompass um what shouse does charles says what you have to do but doesn't necessarily,-1
1134,A-5g0fQcLvQ,A-5g0fQcLvQ_3,"Shall, best practices, and conflicts",give you all the information so so best practices in chat are not necessarily in conflict it's just that best practices have to conform to shall because you shall do it so that's that's an interesting point um there was also an interesting note on this idea of what the police might have to do with respect to this case versus uh gonzales versus castle rock and we don't have to get into the the depths of it here um but for those of you who understand the issue um the the basic issue there is that we have with,-1
1135,A-5g0fQcLvQ,A-5g0fQcLvQ_4,"Shall, best practices, and conflicts",conflicts of law or we have different conflicts of law so we have one law that says to do something and then we have a different law or different principles that are in conflict or potentially in conflict and they have to be resolved right so it may be the case that if you have a statute or regulation that says you shall do something it's at least possible that it can be in conflict with other regulations other mandates other requirements and that's where the lawyers come in right so um obviously someone can tell you you shall do,1
1136,A-5g0fQcLvQ,A-5g0fQcLvQ_5,"Shall, best practices, and conflicts",something but it doesn't necessarily make the command illegal so the regulation may not necessarily be legal or it might be not fully encompassing of all the options so what the regulation says or what the order says is that you shall do something does that mean it's the only thing you can do no you might be able to do more than that does that mean that the order itself is legal no that's what that's what lawyers get paid for is fighting over whether or not things are legal or whether they're in conflicts with other things um,1
1137,A-5g0fQcLvQ,A-5g0fQcLvQ_6,"Shall, best practices, and conflicts",but yeah that i thought that was all really interesting stuff so if you have a if you have a rule or a regulation that says shall uh you must do it unless well that's where the lawyers come in i hope this is helpful until there my friends cheers and goodbye,-1
